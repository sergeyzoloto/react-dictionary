# react-dictionary

In the [React module project](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React/tree/master/week4) a front-end application for a personal dictionary was built. A user can save words in the browser's memory, gather words into collections, and add translation as a custom field. The application also connects to the public API and requests detailed information at the request of the user.

There were created following pages:
- Home page displays a list of words over the selected collections.
- Word page gives a detailed representation of a chosen word, where users can assign words to collections.
- New word page is a simple form for creating new entries.
